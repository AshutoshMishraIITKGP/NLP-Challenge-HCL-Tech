    "text": "Dear Shareholders, \nThis year, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of HCLTech going public. The company’s growth has been nothing short of \nspectacular, establishing itself as one of the finest global corporations out of India with world-class corporate governance, \nsustainability and social responsibility at its core. We have set the benchmark with industry-leading Total Shareholder  \nReturns and several firsts in the industry. Thank you for your support and trust throughout this exciting journey.    \nFY25 marked another year of robust growth for HCLTech. Despite demand challenges, we achieved best-in-class growth  \nfor the second consecutive year. Our services revenue exceeded ₹100,000 crores, grew at 6.5% YoY, and have outperformed  \nour comparable peers for the third year in a row. Our software business maintained over $1 billion annual recurring revenue.  \nThis highlights the strength of our differentiated portfolio that enables our clients navigate the rapid changes in the  \ntechnology landscape led by technologies such as AI and quantum computing. \nWe continue to invest aggressively in our technology  \ncapabilities. We have made significant progress by developing  \na full-stack AI portfolio that allows clients to innovate and deploy \nreal-world solutions at scale. We are also ensuring that we deliver \nour AI capabilities ethically and responsibly. \nHCLTech is adopting AI widely across the organization and  \ninvesting in upskilling employees in AI and allied technologies.  \nOur focus on gender diversity has ensured a diversity rate of  \n29% across the company and 50% at the board level. We continue \nto provide platforms for more women leaders to build long-term \ncareers with HCLTech.  \nSustainability remains a top priority for us and we have made \nconsiderable progress in our journey to becoming a net-zero  \nemission company by 2040. In recognition of these efforts, HCLTech \nwas included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook for the third \nyear in a row and received Gold status from EcoVadis, placing  \nit among the top 5% companies globally. We were also ranked  \nNo. 3 in Brand Finance’s Sustainability Perception Index in India. \nOur uncompromising approach to high standards of  \ngovernance and integrity was recognized by Ethisphere, which \nnamed HCLTech one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies  \n2025. This is the second year in a row we’ve earned this accolade. \nHCLTech, through HCLFoundation and global CSR councils,  \nhas strengthened its social responsibility efforts. In India, we \nhave increased HCLTech Grant outlay for FY26 by 45% to support \ninnovative projects in water management, health, education and \nbiodiversity. We have also pledged to lead the water stewardship  \nin Yamuna basin as a part of the ‘CEO Water Mandate Water \nResilience Coalition’. We believe these initiatives have the  \npromise to deliver impact at scale and create replicable solutions.  \nIt’s also heartening to note the enthusiastic response we have received for the HCLTech Americas Grant initiative that supports  \npath-breaking climate action programs by NGOs in the Americas.\nLooking ahead, the demand environment is expected to remain challenging as clients continue to exercise caution due to \nuncertainties around global trade frameworks and geopolitical tensions. We remain focused on navigating these challenges  \nand ensuring that HCLTech remains well-positioned to leverage the opportunities available. Technology evolution, driven by  \nAI, is accelerating and the IT services industry is at an inflection point. Needless to say, the industry will need to reinvent itself  \nto stay relevant. HCLTech is prepared to adapt to these shifts. \nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the HCLTech leadership team and the 223,000+ HCLTechies led by our  \nManaging Director & CEO, C Vijayakumar, for their passion and commitment, which make HCLTech stand apart year after year. \nI also thank our shareholders, clients and business partners for their continued trust and support. \nBest regards,\nRoshni Nadar Malhotra We continue to invest \naggressively in our \ntechnology capabilities. \nWe have made significant \nprogress by developing a \nfull-stack AI portfolio that \nallows clients to innovate \nand deploy real-world \nsolutions at scale. We \nare also ensuring that we \ndeliver our AI capabilities \nethically and responsibly.\nCorporate Overview\n2"

    "text": "Business Strategy\nStrategy helps an organization to make choices and, more importantly, trade-offs. An effective strategy aligns  \nstakeholders — clients, employees, partners, society and shareholders — to pursue shared goals of success and  \nvalue creation. This shared focus ensures mutual interlocking and reinforcement of numerous decisions made  \ndaily across various aspects of the business. The key to the success of any strategy is to ensure the right choices  \nare made consistently by all stakeholders by articulating the strategy clearly.\nFor over four decades, HCLTech has built a culture of empowerment and innovation. Our leaders play a crucial role  \nin translating strategy into practical, flexible guidelines that can be easily followed and implemented by everyone.  \nTo unleash the creative potential of our people, our strategic framework has remained simple and clear, aligned to  \nthe art of the possible. This simple yet effective approach ignites passion and ownership among our employees. We set \nforth a small set of priorities vital for our success and empower our people to execute them with enthusiasm and boldness. \nAligned to this approach, we have our five medium-term \nstrategic objectives:\n• Leadership through differentiated services and  \nproducts leveraging our engineering pedigree \n• Employer of choice for professional services talent \nacross chosen geographies\n• Preferred digital and AI partner for Global 2000, \nequivalent and emerging enterprises in chosen markets \n• Weave ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)  \ninto business strategy \n• Continue to deliver top quartile TSR (Total Shareholder \nReturn) over the medium-term\nThese medium-term strategic objectives (SOs) address \nthe critical components necessary for business success, \nensuring that all aspects of the organization, including \ngoals, resources and activities, are coordinated and \naligned to achieve the desired outcomes. We regularly \nassess and update our strategic objectives to ensure  \nthey remain relevant, leading to revisions in FY25. We have \nexpanded further on each of these strategic objectives in \nthe Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section.\nThe underlying principles that guide us in pursuing  \nand attaining these strategic objectives are as follows:\n• Our culture of empowerment and innovation -  \nOur commitment to excellence is deeply embedded  \nin our cultural DNA. Our culture combines optimism  \nwith realism, driving passion and innovation.\n• Talent is at the center of every decision – Our employee \nvalue proposition, ‘Find your Spark,’ aims to inspire and \nempower employees by aligning our business model \nand talent strategy with their aspirations. We focus on \ncreating enriching experiences and a next-gen work \nenvironment to help employees reach their full potential.\n• Enablement to drive execution - HCLTech ensures \nstrategic objectives are clear and achievable  \nby breaking them into specific initiatives, more  \nimportantly supported by enablement frameworks  \nand cross-functional collaboration. This approach  \naligns initiatives with broader objectives, driving \norganizational interlock, key to success and growth.• Beyond benchmarking - HCLTech uses benchmarking \nto identify and adopt best practices and drive strategic \nobjectives, focusing on parameters like stakeholder \nsatisfaction and financial performance. This approach \naims to advance strategic objectives rather than just \naligning with competitors.\n• Benefit from current and future opportunities -  \nWe use a structured approach to detect market \ndisruptions early, converting risks into opportunities for \nboth short-term and long-term growth. We continuously \nmonitor market signals to identify and capitalize on \nopportunities across existing and new domains and  \nact promptly to gain competitive advantage.\n• Rethink competitive advantage through  \nnon-linear approach - HCLTech is focusing on achieving  \nnon-linear growth by leveraging AI/GenAI and other \nemerging technologies to enhance client experiences, \ndrive innovation and improve efficiency. The company \naims to decouple revenue from traditional models \nthrough AI-driven innovation and integration  \nof advanced technologies, fostering a dynamic  \nand customer-centric ecosystem.\n• Enhance value through efficient capital allocation - \nHCLTech practices disciplined budgeting and strategic \ninvestment to ensure efficient capital use, driving value \nthrough sustainable growth and competitive advantage. \nThis approach enables resilience and long-term \nstakeholder value.\n• Align the larger ecosystem to strategic objectives -  \nWe communicate our strategic goals and progress  \nto key external stakeholders through regular updates  \nand transparent reporting. This approach attracts  \nclients, investors and partners, fostering trust, driving \ngrowth and aligning them with our long-term journey.\nPeter Drucker’s epithet that “strategy is a commodity, \nexecution is an art” is often mentioned to reinforce the \nimportance of culture in executing strategy. This assertion \nunderscores the idea that while formulating a strategic \nplan is imperative, the true test lies in its implementation. \nThe organizational culture sets the tone for how strategies \nare perceived, accepted and executed. At HCLTech, \nthrough the intelligent integration of both culture and \nstrategy, we execute impeccably to supercharge progress.\nValue Creation\nApproachFinancial\nCapital\nSocial and\nRelationship\nCapitalHuman\nCapital\nIntellectual\nCapital\nNatural\nCapital\nCorporate Overview\n56"

Physical risks include extreme weather events like droughts, floods, cyclones, wildfires and heat stress. Transition risks include changes in policy and regulatory context leading to increased carbon prices, taxes and cost of doing business. It also includes business continuity risks. The oppo/r_t.ligaunity to be climate resilient and climate positive includes developing climate resilient processes, operations, value chain, products, services and solutions that not only suppo/r_t.liga our journey but also that of our clients and pa/r_t.liganers.As a pa/r_t.liga of our net- zero strategy, HCLTech is commi/t_t.ligaed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions aligned to the 1.5ºC pathway by 2030 and to achieving net zero by 2040. A clear roadmap is planned towards this commitment. We are making steady progress on this roadmap. HCLTech is also developing products, services and solutions that help clients and pa/r_t.liganers meet their commitments on climate change. HCLTech has continued its journey to identify and execute projects to work with communities to move towards a climate resilient future.The financial implications of climate change risk are disruption to business operations and increased cost of doing business.\nThe financial \noppo/r_t.ligaunity of being climate resilient and climate positive is enhanced business continuity, robust operations, cost saving and increased business revenues.\nDetails are covered in \nthe TCFD disclosures."

HCLTech has defined monitoring and governance systems covering all eco¯efficiency \nparameters. These are reviewed at regular intervals and budgets are allocated for pe/r_f.ligaormance improvement.Lower pe/r_f.ligaormance on eco¯efficiency carries \nthe risk of increased costs of doing business. Improvement in eco¯efficiency directly \nleads to cost savings and resilient business operations.\n3Human CapitalRisk and oppo/r_t.ligaunityHCLTech defines human capital as skills, knowledge and experience possessed by an employee or a team, that can be valuable to the organization. We require constant upskilling and reskilling of our employees to ensure we deliver top services to our clients in a rapidly evolving digital technology space. Human capital is an impo/r_t.ligaant risk as well as oppo/r_t.ligaunity for us.HCLTech has a clear institutional mechanism to map future skillset requirements and has programs for upskilling and reskilling employees. There are measurements used to gauge the pe/r_f.ligaormance of the initiative, which are reviewed periodically.The financial implication of the risk is potential loss of business oppo/r_t.ligaunity if adequate and appropriate human capital is not available. Readiness on human capital creates oppo/r_t.ligaunities to cater to client and business needs leading to revenue growth.\n4 Local hiring Oppo/r_t.ligaunityHiring local talent in places where we do business is an impo/r_t.ligaant risk and oppo/r_t.ligaunity for us.Hiring locally is not just the right thing to do, but an effective strategy to improve talent retention. It also conveys our commitment to the community that we are invested in that location. Across the globe, in the countries where we operate, we are investing in local talent. As a strategy HCLTech has expanded its offices to smaller cities (New Vistas) and provided a hybrid workspace to fu/r_t.ligaher enable people prospects.Improved talent retention and be/t_t.ligaer relations with the community and clients lead to steady long term revenue growth and ability to deliver on that growth."

There is ample evidence to highlight that having diverse perspectives in a team creates be/t_t.ligaer work outcomes in addition to be/t_t.ligaer team coherence and has a positive impact on creativity, problem¯solving \nand overall organizational success.HCLTech has clear policies, processes and governance structures to monitor the pe/r_f.ligaormance of our D&I strategy. We have an ESG and DEI Commi/t_t.ligaee set up in our Board to ensure a strategic focus. Goals and targets are identified and integrated into the pe/r_f.ligaormance evaluation of leaders. A separate team works on various initiatives to fu/r_t.ligaher our commitment.Absence of D&I robustness may lead to narrow perspectives that may impact quality and output of work.\nRobust presence of \nD&I may potentially lead to comprehensive solutions driving be/t_t.ligaer business outcomes in addition to inclusive workplace. Inclusive workplace may drive be/t_t.ligaer productivity, innovation and retention of talent.\n6Talent a/t_t.ligaraction and retentionRisk and Oppo/r_t.ligaunityMeeting the increasing demand for new talent poses a significant risk and a unique oppo/r_t.ligaunity.\nThe increasing shifts globally \ntowards the adoption of digital solutions and increasing range and diversity of technology solutions have put the focus on striving the right balance between demand and supply of appropriate skillsets. We view it as an oppo/r_t.ligaunity to align our work culture with global trends, thereby enhancing employee retention while also increasing their efficiency.HCLTech’s strategy is to focus on building the workplace of tomorrow—one which promotes equality of oppo/r_t.ligaunity, a collaborative and transparent culture and deploys a robust training strategy designed to meet the development needs of employees at all levels. The company provides employees with progressive career paths through internal oppo/r_t.ligaunities.Failing to effectively a/t_t.ligaract and retain talented individuals can result in missed oppo/r_t.ligaunities for growth and innovation, leading to decreased productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, the costs associated with recruiting, onboarding and training new employees are significant.\nOn the other hand, \nsuccessfully a/t_t.ligaracting and retaining the right talent leads to direct pe/r_f.ligaormance gains and ability to cater to new growth oppo/r_t.ligaunities leading to be/t_t.ligaer revenues."

It is also impo/r_t.ligaant to create an environment that is safe where employees have the confidence and trust to repo/r_t.liga on any kind of discrimination or harassment.\nWe ensure that our offices \nare designed and planned to ensure the comfo/r_t.liga of our employees.\nWe have clear policies \nand processes to prevent any discrimination and harassment in our workplaces. These are communicated regularly and employees are encouraged to repo/r_t.liga on any incidents.\nWe have tracking \nmechanisms to ensure we take preventive steps. Independent investigation of incidents is also ensured.The comfo/r_t.liga and trust of the employees in a good work environment results in dedicated employees. Hence the financial impact is a result of healthy and safe employees pe/r_f.ligaorming to their full potential. A workplace incident can result in a loss of reputation to the organization and this can result in potential loss of oppo/r_t.ligaunities.\n8 Citizenship Oppo/r_t.ligaunityCorporate citizenship is not just an oppo/r_t.ligaunity for HCLTech but rather it is the backbone of the organization. It is our responsibility to the community in which we operate.\nHCLFoundation in India and the various employee councils around the world highlight our focus. Apa/r_t.liga from the positive impact on the community members/program pa/r_t.ligaicipants, our initiatives demonstrate our commitment to the communities in which we operate.Outcomes resulting from improved trust and credibility in the community can bring potential financial oppo/r_t.ligaunities for HCLTech."

Therefore, we created a dedicated team which works with various sector heads to identify oppo/r_t.ligaunities related to sustainability and create appropriate sustainability¯related \nsolutions for our clients.The direct financial impact will emerge from the creation of new oppo/r_t.ligaunities with clients. Indirect benefits include the creation of environmental and social capital."

This has led to a greater focus on the need to build robust, secure and sophisticated solutions that are secure, safe and robust. Data privacy and security are critical features.HCLTech ensures a globally interconnected oversight framework involving governance, policies, procedures, training and awareness programs, global privacy impact assessments, privacy by design, data mapping, third¯pa/r_t.ligay \ncontractual oversight, incident management and a mechanism for monitoring regulatory compliance for every geography.\nOur Crisis & Resilience \nprogram highlights our focus on integrating resilience as an intrinsic pa/r_t.liga of our business operating model and seeks to embed “resilience by design” across the dimensions of work, personnel, workplace, business operations, technology, supply chain and leadership.\nOur Information and \ncybersecurity program ensures a strong security posture for HCLTech and our clients. Our security posture has been validated by independent, industry recognized ce/r_t.ligaifications and a/t_t.ligaestation standards, including qua/r_t.ligaerly oversight by the Board. We also have cyber insurance that covers different types of breaches and cyber events.Any incident has a direct impact on that specific project with the client or on HCLTech as an organization. It may lead to regulatory implications, reputational challenges and financial implications."

A supply chain that is at odds with our sustainability goals and priorities is a risk to our achievement of our goals.Through responsible sourcing, collaboration with upstream and downstream pa/r_t.liganers and improving supply chain governance, HCLTech has integrated sustainability into its procurement process. Both the Supplier Code of Conduct and Procurement Policy has integrated sustainability requirements. ESG has been incorporated as a risk domain in the Vendor onboarding process for new vendors. \nHCLTech has also \nconducted risk evaluation of the supply chain based on ESG guidelines and identified categories and vendors who will be audited. The audit requirements are integrated into the Vendor Risk Management program (R&C).Non¯adherence to \nESG guidelines in the supply chain can lead to associated reputation damage and thwa/r_t.liga progress on our sustainability goals.\nIntegration of \nour sustainability goals in our supply chain increases our effectiveness in meeting these goals and leads to greater positive impact."

Governance and Ethics are the foundations of the HCLTech culture. We structure our governance to permeate ethical conduct throughout the organization. Our strong governance and ethical culture ensure our viability over the long term.\nThe Code of Business Ethics \nand Conduct (COBEC) is our principal document that outlines the way HCLTech employees should conduct business.\nThe whistle¯blower policy \nand various other repo/r_t.ligaing \nchannels help to identify any challenges that need to be corrected. The Board reviews this periodically through the Audit Commi/t_t.ligaee.\nWe are focused on \nboth current and future regulations to ensure we are fully prepared for any change.Non¯compliance \nwith corporate governance regulations can have several financial implications and reputational consequences. \nRegulatory actions \ntaken against the company can lead to penalties, fines and legal expenses, negatively impacting its financial pe/r_f.ligaormance. \nMoreover, there is a \nrisk associated with incidents that may not be regulatory in nature but still raise questions about the ethical conduct of the business."

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis \nby the entity?\nHCLTech has established, implemented, and maintained a formal process for hazard identification, risk \nassessment and control to effectively manage workplace and safety hazards across our facilities. HCLTech uses the failure mode effect analysis (“FMEA”) to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis.\nAfter risks are identified, the following steps are taken:\n● Risk Evaluation: The identified risks are assessed using the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which considers the \nSeverity, Occurrence, and Detection of each failure mode.\n● Action Plan Development: High-priority risks are addressed by creating mitigation strategies, such as design changes, process improvements, or additional controls.\n● Implementation of Actions: The corrective measures are applied to reduce the likelihood of failure, minimize impact, or improve detection methods.\n● Re-evaluation: The updated process or design is reviewed, and a new RPN is calculated to confirm the effectiveness of the actions taken.\nThe above steps ensure a continuous cycle of improvement to minimize risks and enhance system reliability.\nc. Whether you have processes for workers to repo/r_t.liga the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such \nrisks. (Y/N)\nYes, we have established processes for workers to repo/r_t.liga work-related hazards and remove themselves from risky \nsituations. Key steps involved are as follows:\n● Hazard Identification: Workers are encouraged to identify and recognize potential hazards in the workplace. This is done through regular inspections, observations, and feedback.\n● Repo/r_t.ligaing Channels: Workers can repo/r_t.liga hazards through various channels such as direct communication with supervisors, dedicated safety commi/t_t.ligaees, or anonymous repo/r_t.ligaing systems.\n● Documentation: Proper documentation of the hazard is crucial. This includes detailing the nature of the hazard, its location, and any immediate risks it poses.\n● Immediate Action: Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous situations if they believe there is an imminent risk to their health or safety. \n● Follow-Up: After a hazard is repo/r_t.ligaed, there is a follow-up process to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the workplace is safe.\n● Training and Education: Regular training sessions are conducted to educate workers on how to identify, repo/r_t.liga, and handle workplace hazards effectively.\nd.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are fu/r_t.ligaher described in the \nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the \nAudit of the Standalone Financial Statements  section \nof our repo/r_t.liga. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Cha/r_t.ligaered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\nKey Audit Ma/t_t.ligaer\nKey audit ma/t_t.ligaers are those ma/t_t.ligaers that, in our \nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These ma/t_t.ligaers were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these ma/t_t.ligaers.\nEvaluation of tax positions and litigations\nSee Note 1(h) and 3.27 to standalone financial statementsThe key audit ma/t_t.ligaer How the ma/t_t.ligaer was addressed in our audit\nThe Company is required to \nestimate its income tax liabilities in accordance with the tax laws applicable in India. Fu/r_t.ligaher, there are ma/t_t.ligaers of interpretation in terms of application of tax laws and related rules to determine current tax provision and deferred taxes.\nThe Company has material tax \npositions and litigations on a range of tax ma/t_t.ligaers. This requires management to make significant judgments to determine the possible outcome of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations and their consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the standalone financial statements.In view of the significance of the ma/t_t.ligaer we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:\n● testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Company’s key controls over identifying unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and ma/t_t.ligaers involving litigations.\n● obtaining details of tax positions and tax litigations for the year and as at31 March 2025 and holding discussions with designated management personnel.\n● assessing and analysing select key correspondences with tax authorities and inspecting external legal opinions obtained by management for key unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and tax litigations.\n● evaluating underlying evidence and documentation to determine whether the information provides a basis for amounts provided/not provided in the books of account.\n● involving our internal tax specialists and evaluating management’s underlying key assumptions in estimating the tax provisions and possible outcome of material tax positions and litigations; and\n● in respect of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations, assessing the computation of provisions and consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the standalone financial statements."

If, based on the work we have pe/r_f.ligaormed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to repo/r_t.liga that fact. We have nothing to repo/r_t.liga in this regard.\nManagement’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for \nthe Standalone Financial Statements\nThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors are \nresponsible for the ma/t_t.ligaers stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, the \nManagement and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, ma/t_t.ligaers related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing \nthe Company’s financial repo/r_t.ligaing process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s repo/r_t.liga that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\nAs pa/r_t.liga of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and pe/r_f.ligaorm audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n● Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material unce/r_t.ligaainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material unce/r_t.ligaainty exists, we are required to draw a/t_t.ligaention in our auditor’s repo/r_t.liga to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s repo/r_t.liga. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements,"

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditor’s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and pe/r_f.ligaorm the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves pe/r_f.ligaorming procedures to obtain audit \nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to \nFinancial Statements\nA company’s internal financial controls with reference \nto financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial repo/r_t.ligaing and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pe/r_t.ligaain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with \nReference to Financial Statements\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial \ncontrols with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nForB S R & Co.

The Company was incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India in November 1991, having its registered office at 806, Siddha/r_t.ligah, 96, Nehru Place, New Delhi - 110019. The Company leverages its global technology workforce and intellectual prope/r_t.ligaies to deliver solutions across following ve/r_t.ligaicals - Financial Services, Manufacturing, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Public Services, Retail & CPG, Technology & Services and Telecom, Media, Publishing and Ente/r_t.ligaainment.\nThe standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved and authorized for issue by the \nBoard of Directors on 22 April 2025.\n1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n(a) Basis of preparation\nThese standalone financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian \nAccounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Schedule III (Division II) to the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable to the standalone financial statements.\nThese standalone financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual \nand going concern basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:\n(a) Derivative financial instruments,\n(b) Ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments),\n(c) Defined benefit plans\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these standalone financial statements are consistent with \nthose of the previous year except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy.\nAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating \ncycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method.\nThe Company uses the Indian rupee (‘/uni20B9’) as its repo/r_t.ligaing currency. All amounts are presented in crores of \n/uni20B9rounded to whole number and amounts less than /uni20B90.50 crores are presented as “-”.\n(b) Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates and judgements that affect the repo/r_t.ligaed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and other comprehensive income (OCI) that are repo/r_t.ligaed and disclosed in the standalone financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may unde/r_t.ligaake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the standalone financial statements in the year in which the changes are made.\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions are used for, but not limited to,\n(i) Accounting for costs expected to be incurred to complete pe/r_f.ligaormance under fixed price projects and \ndetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation in contracts involving \nmultiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, refer note 1(f).\n(ii) Allowance for uncollectible trade receivables, refer note 1(s)(i).\n(iii) Fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent consideration) and fair value of the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed, measured on a provisional basis in case of business combinations, refer \nnote 1(c).\n(iv) Recognition of income and deferred taxes, refer note 1(h) and note 3.27.\n(v) Key actuarial assumptions for measurement of future obligations under employee benefit plans, refer note \n1(q) and note 3.32."

The cost of an acquisition is the \naggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition \ndate. Contingent consideration classified as financial liability is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and \nany previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is recognized as capital reserve after reassessing the fair values of the net assets.\n(d) Foreign currency and translation\nThe financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (/uni20B9), which is also the Company’s functional currency. For each foreign operation, the Company determines the functional currency which is its respective local currency.\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at their respective functional currency \nspot rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on se/t_t.ligalement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of initial transaction. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined.\nTransaction gains or losses realized upon se/t_t.ligalement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining \nnet profit for the year. Revenue, expenses and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.\nThe translation of foreign operations from respective functional currency into INR (the repo/r_t.ligaing currency) \nfor assets and liabilities is pe/r_f.ligaormed using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and for revenue, expenses and cash flows is pe/r_f.ligaormed using an appropriate daily weighted average exchange rate for the respective years. The exchange differences arising on translation are repo/r_t.ligaed as a component of ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that pa/r_t.ligaicular foreign operation is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n(e) Fair value measurement\nThe Company records ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines fair values based on the price it would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market pa/r_t.ligaicipants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.\nThe Company holds ce/r_t.ligaain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which must be measured \nusing the guidance for fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies. The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or"

    "text": "Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025\n(All amounts in crores of /uni20B9, except share data and as stated otherwise)\n262 Standalone Financial Statementsunobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable \ninputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments \nin markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable in active markets.\nLevel 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable \ninputs which are suppo/r_t.ligaed by li/t_t.ligale or no market activity.\nIn accordance with Ind AS 113, assets and liabilities at fair value are measured based on the following valuation \ntechniques:\n(a) Market approach – Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving \nidentical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n(b) Income approach – Conve/r_t.ligaing the future amounts based on market expectations to its present value using the discounting method.\n(c) Cost approach – Replacement cost method.\nCe/r_t.ligaain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets consist primarily of non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in business combinations are measured at fair value initially and subsequently when there is an indicator of impairment, the impairment is recognized.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market pa/r_t.ligaicipant’s ability to generate \neconomic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r_t.ligaicipant who would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n(f) Revenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised service or good transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration (Transaction price) to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services (Pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation). Revenue is recognized for any contract, once it is approved in writing, is legally enforceable, the rights of the pa/r_t.ligaies are identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is measured based on the Transaction price which is the consideration of the contract and is shown net of applicable taxes and adjusted for any variable consideration like volume discounts, service level allowances, incentive or any other discount. Transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.\nRevenue from time-and-material, volume based, and transaction-based contracts is recognized as the related \nservices are pe/r_f.ligaormed through effo/r_t.ligas expended, units serviced, number of transactions processed, etc. that correspond with value transferred to customer.\nRevenue related to fixed price contracts where pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations and control are satisfied over a period \nof time like technology integration contracts, complex network building contracts, system implementations and application development contracts is recognized based on progress towards completion of the pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation using percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Any revision in cost to complete would result in an increase or decrease in revenue and such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified.\nIn arrangements involving sharing of customer revenues for services delivered, revenue is recognized when the \nright to receive such revenue share is established.\nRevenue related to other fixed price contracts providing maintenance and suppo/r_t.liga services, are recognized based \non the right to invoice for services pe/r_f.ligaormed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenues are recognized basis stand-alone"

The Company uses cost plus expected margin to determine stand-alone \nselling price.\nRevenue from distinct proprietary software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement \nwhen right to use is granted to the customer. In the case of renewals of term licenses with existing customers, revenue from term license is recognized at a point in time when the renewal is agreed on signing of contracts. Revenue from suppo/r_t.liga and subscription (S&S) is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis as the Company is providing a service of standing ready to provide suppo/r_t.liga, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. In case software are bundled with suppo/r_t.liga and subscription either for perpetual or term based license, such suppo/r_t.liga and subscription contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the suppo/r_t.liga services are provided.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains provision of multiple products, services and software licenses, company \nidentifies the distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation including lease obligation and allocates total consideration to each pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation on a relative standalone selling price. Company uses cost plus expected margin to determine standalone selling price. Revenue from finance leases is recognized when all risks and ownership are transferred to the customer, with no remaining obligations that affect acceptance. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of lease payments, discounted at a market interest rate. Interest from finance leases is recognized as other income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.\nIn instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-pa/r_t.ligay vendor services, material or licenses, revenue is \nrecorded on a gross basis when the Company is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, once control of a promised good is transferred to a customer.\nRevenue from ce/r_t.ligaain activities in transition services in outsourcing arrangements are not capable of being \ndistinct or represent separate pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation and is recognized over the period of the arrangement. Direct and incremental costs in relation to such transition activities which are expected to be recoverable under the contract are considered as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Deferred contract cost and recognized over the period of arrangement. Ce/r_t.ligaain upfront non-recurring incremental contract acquisition costs and other upfront fee paid to customer are deferred and classified as Deferred contract cost and amo/r_t.ligaized to revenue, usually on a straight-line basis, over the term of the contract.\nAn onerous contract provision is recognized when the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the future \nobligations exceed the expected economic benefits to be received under a contract. Such provision, if any, is recorded in the period in which such losses become probable and is included in the cost of revenues.\nContract assets are recognized when revenue recognized is more than billing and right to consideration is \nconditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Unbilled receivables are recognized where the right to consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before the payment is due (i.e., only act of invoicing is pending). Contract liability is Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to customers when there is excess billing over the revenue recognized.\n(g) Other income\nOther income mainly comprises interest income on debt securities, bank and other deposits, other interest income recognized using the effective interest method, profit on sale of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipments, debt securities and mutual fund and net foreign exchange gains. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.\n(h) Income taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax.\nIncome tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items \nrecognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes the impact of provisions established for unce/r_t.ligaain income tax positions. Tax assets and"

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for those temporary differences which originate during the tax holiday period and are reversed after the tax holiday period. For this purpose, reversal of timing differences is determined using first-in-first-out method.\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or se/t_t.ligaled.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current \ntax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\nThe effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or \nexpense in the year that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.\nTax benefits acquired as pa/r_t.liga of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition \nat that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nIn some tax jurisdictions, the amount of tax deductions on share based payments to employees are different \nfrom the related cumulative remuneration expenses. If the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, such excess amount of tax deduction and the associated tax benefit is recognized directly in retained earnings.\n(i) Prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment\nPrope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and directly a/t_t.ligaributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. The Company identifies and determines separate useful lives for each major component of the prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, if they have a useful life that is materially different from that of the asset as a whole.\nExpenses on existing prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repairs, maintenance expenditure and \ncost of replacing pa/r_t.ligas, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the year during which such expenses are incurred.\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal \nproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.\nPrope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment under construction and cost of assets not ready for use at the year-end are \ndisclosed as capital work - in - progress.\nDepreciation on prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method over their estimated \nuseful lives, as determined by the management. Depreciation is charged on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/sold during the year."

The estimated useful lives for these assets are therefore different from the useful lives prescribed under Pa/r_t.liga C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are reviewed at \neach financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n(j) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequently, following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are amo/r_t.ligaized over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication \nthat the intangible asset may be impaired. The amo/r_t.ligaization period and the amo/r_t.ligaization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each repo/r_t.ligaing year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pa/t_t.ligaern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amo/r_t.ligaization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amo/r_t.ligaization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net \ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.\nThe intangible assets are amo/r_t.ligaized over the estimated useful life of the assets as mentioned below:\nAsset description Asset life (in years)\nSoftwareOver the term of license or\n3 years, whichever is lower\nTechnology (including Licensed IPRs) 2 to 15\nCustomer-related intangibles (includes customer contracts and customer \nrelationships)2 to 10\nOthers (includes intellectual prope/r_t.ligay rights, brand and non-compete agreements)5\n(k) Research and development costs\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure, on an individual project, is recognized as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate:\n● The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale\n● Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset"

Amo/r_t.ligaization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amo/r_t.ligaized over the period of expected future benefit. Amo/r_t.ligaization expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.\n(l) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalized as pa/r_t.liga of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.\nBorrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of \nfunds.\n(m) Leases\nA lease is a contract that contains right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nCompany as a lessee\nCompany is lessee in case of leasehold land, office space, accommodation for its employees & IT equipment. These leases are evaluated to determine whether it contains lease based on principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors as defined in Ind AS 116.\nRight-of-use asset represents the Company’s right to control the underlying assets under lease and the lease \nliability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying asset under lease. Right-of-use asset is measured initially based on the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent, and lease incentives. Right-of-use asset is depreciated based on straight line method over the lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset, whichever is less. Subsequently, right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability.\nThe lease liability is measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the \nminimum lease payments not yet paid and the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the Company would borrow, in the country where the lease was executed. The Company has used a single discount rate for a po/r_t.ligafolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The lease payment comprises fixed payment less any lease incentives, variable lease payment that depends on an index or a rate, exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably ce/r_t.ligaain to exercise the option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising an option to terminate the lease. Lease liability is subsequently measured by increase the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payment made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or modification, if any.\nThe Company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of 12 months or less in the balance sheet, \nincluding those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those sho/r_t.liga-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the statement of profit and loss. For all asset classes, the Company has elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and account for the combined unit as a single lease component in case there is no separate payment defined under the contract.\nCompany as a lessor\nLeases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the year in which they are earned or contingency is resolved."

Assets given under finance lease are recognized as a receivables at an amount equal to the present value of lease receivables. After initial recognition, the Company appo/r_t.ligaions lease rentals between the principal repayment and interest income so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance leases. The interest income is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs such as legal cost, brokerage cost etc. are recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\nWhen arrangements include multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration in the \ncontract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.\n(n) Inventories\nStock-in-trade, stores and spares are valued at the lower of the cost or net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\nCost of stock-in-trade procured for specific projects is assigned by identifying individual costs of each item. Cost \nof stock-in-trade, that are interchangeable and not specific to any project and cost of stores and spare pa/r_t.ligas are determined using the weighted average cost formula.\n(o) Impairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually on March 31, for impairment, or sooner whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and future cash flows. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Company’s cash generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.\nAn impairment loss on goodwill recognized in the statement of profit and loss is not reversed in the subsequent \nperiod.\nIntangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment\nIntangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. Subsequently if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is reversed. Such reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined on the date of reversal, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Such impairment and any subsequent reversal is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n(p) Provisions and contingent liabilities\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows."

Contingent liabilities are disclosed \nwhen there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more unce/r_t.ligaain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n(q) Retirement and other employee benefits\n(i) Provident fund: Employees of the Company receive benefits under the provident fund, a defined benefit \nplan. The employee and employer each make monthly contributions to the plan. A po/r_t.ligaion of the contribution is made to the provident fund trust managed by the Company or Government administered provident fund; while the balance contribution is made to the Government administered pension fund, a defined contribution plan. For the contribution made by the Company to the provident fund trust managed by the Company, the Company has an obligation to fund any sho/r_t.ligafall on the yield of the Trust’s investments over the administered interest rates. The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of the year. The funds contributed to the Trust are invested in specific securities as mandated by law and generally consist of federal and state government bonds, debt instruments of government-owned corporations, equity and other eligible market securities.\n(ii) In respect of superannuation, a defined contribution plan for applicable employees, the Company \ncontributes to the superannuation trust and the scheme is administered on its behalf by appointed fund managers and such contributions for each year of service rendered by the employees are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The Company has no fu/r_t.ligaher obligations to the superannuation plan beyond its contributions.\n(iii) Gratuity liability: The Company provide for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering \neligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s base salary and the tenure of employment (subject to a maximum of /uni20B920 lacs per employee). The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial gains/losses are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.\nIn respect to ce/r_t.ligaain employees in India, the Company contributes towards gratuity liabilities to the Gratuity \nFund Trust. Trustees of the Company administer contributions made to the Trust and contributions are invested in a scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India as permi/t_t.ligaed by law.\n(iv) Compensated absences: The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences which are \nboth accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The employees can carry forward up to the specified po/r_t.ligaion of the unutilized accumulated compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation (using the projected unit credit method) based on the additional amount expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. The expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which the absences occur. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred.\n(v) Contributions to other defined contribution plans in branches outside India are recognized as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.\n(r) Equity se/t_t.ligaled share based compensation\nShare-based compensation represents the cost related to share-based awards granted to employees. The Company measures share-based compensation cost at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight line basis (net of estimated fo/r_f.ligaeitures) over the employee’s requisite service period for an award with only service condition and for an award with both service and pe/r_f.ligaormance condition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting po/r_t.ligaion of the award, as if award was in substance, multiple awards. On modification of an equity se/t_t.ligaled award, the Company re-estimates the fair value of stock option as on the date of modification and any incremental expense is expensed over the period from the modification date till the vesting date."

The cost is recorded under the \nhead employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss with corresponding increase in “Share based payment reserve”.\nThe Company grants share-based awards to employees of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, requiring \nreimbursement for the actual cost of treasury shares upon exercise. Any excess cost over the fair value recovered from subsidiaries is treated as a reduction in investment.\n(s) Financial Instruments\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\ni. Financial assets\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the \nacquisition of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit and loss) are added to the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset. Purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.\n  Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash in banks and sho/r_t.liga-term deposits and investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are considered net of outstanding \nbank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered pa/r_t.liga of the Company’s cash management system. In the standalone balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities.\n   Financial assets at amo/r_t.ligaized cost\n  A financial asset is measured at the amo/r_t.ligaized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows and,\n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of   principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category includes cash and bank balances, loans, unbilled receivables, trade and other receivables.\n  Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)\nA financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n(i) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling \nthe financial assets, and\n(ii) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\nFinancial asset included within the OCI category are measured initially as well as at each repo/r_t.ligaing date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in OCI. Interest income is recognized in statement of profit and loss for debt instruments. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from OCI to statement of profit and loss.\n  Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\nAny financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization at amo/r_t.ligaized cost or at fair value"

Financial assets \nincluded at the fair value through profit and loss category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n  Equity investments\nEquity investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment if any.\n  Derecognition of financial assets\nA financial asset is primarily derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset.\n  Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance is recognized for trade receivables with no significant financing component. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case they are measured at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r_t.ligaing date is recognized in statement of profit and loss.\nii. Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly a/t_t.ligaributable transaction costs.\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n  Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated as \nsuch at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n  Financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost\nThe Company’s financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost, are initially recognized at net of transaction costs and includes trade payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts and other payables.\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective \ninterest rate (EIR) method except for deferred consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amo/r_t.ligaization process.\nAmo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or \ncosts that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.\n  Derecognition\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.\niii. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nForeign exchange forward contracts and options are purchased to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with forecast transactions denominated in ce/r_t.ligaain foreign currencies.\nThe Company recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. Changes in fair \nvalue for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are marked to market at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and the related gains (losses) are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as ‘foreign exchange gains (losses)’."

Changes in the fair value of derivatives (net of tax) that are designated as effective cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in the hedging reserve account as a component of accumulated ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’ until the hedged transaction occurs and are then recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The ineffective po/r_t.ligaion of hedging derivatives is immediately recognized in other income (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss.\nIn respect of derivatives designated as hedges, the Company formally documents all relationships \nbetween hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for unde/r_t.ligaaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively from the last testing date when (1) it is determined that the \nderivative financial instrument is no longer effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure being hedged; (2) the derivative financial instrument matures or is sold, terminated or exercised; or (3) it is determined that designating the derivative financial instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued the deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’ until the forecast transaction occurs. Any fu/r_t.ligaher change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current year earnings.\n  Offse/t_t.ligaing of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is repo/r_t.ligaed in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to se/t_t.ligale on a net basis to realize the assets and se/t_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously.\n(t) Dividend\nFinal dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is recognized upon approval by the shareholders who have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend excludes dividend on treasury shares.\n(u) Earnings per share (EPS)\nBasic EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for treasury shares held.\nDiluted EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Company \nby the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The diluted potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares). Pe/r_f.ligaormance based stock unit awards are included in dilutive potential shares when they become contingently issuable and have a dilutive impact and are excluded when they are not contingently issuable. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed conve/r_t.ligaed as at the beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each year presented.\nThe number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented \nfor bonus shares.\n(v) Nature and purpose of reserves\nRemeasurement of defined benefit plans\nThe Company recognizes actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans in the balance sheet with a \ncorresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur."

Impairment is recognized, when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The estimated value-in-use of the CGU is based on the future cash flow forecasts for 5 years and then on perpetuity on the basis of ce/r_t.ligaain assumptions which include revenue growth, earnings before interest and taxes, taxes, capital outflow and working capital requirement. The assumptions are taken on the basis of past trends and management estimates and judgement. Future cash flows are discounted with “Weighted Average Cost of Capital”.\nThe key assumptions are as follows:\nAs at 31 March 2025\nIT and Business \nServicesEngineering and \nR&D servicesHCLSoftware\nRevenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 6.8 5.1 1.0\nTerminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.8)\nPre-tax discount rate (%) 13.2 14.1 17.3\nAs at 31 March 2024\nIT and Business \nServicesEngineering and \nR&D servicesHCLSoftware\nRevenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 7.8 6.0 (0.6)\nTerminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.1)\nPre-tax discount rate (%) 12.6 13.8 16.2\nAs at 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, the estimated recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded the carrying \namount and accordingly, no impairment was recognized. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key assumptions based on reasonable probability did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGUs would decrease below the carrying amount.\n3.4 Other intangible assets\nThe changes in the carrying value for the year ended 31 March 2025\nSoftwareTechnology \n(including \nLicensed IPRs)Customer-\nrelated \nintangiblesOthers Total\nGross block as at 1 April 2024 515 7,498 6,391 14 14,418\nAdditions 3 6 - - 9\nAcquired through business \ncombination- 710 16 - 726\nDisposals/other adjustments (18) - - (7) (25)\nTranslation exchange differences3 - 1 - 4\nGross block as at 31 March 2025503 8,214 6,408 7 15,132\nAccumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment as at 1 April 2024458 4,438 3,998 13 8,907"

Market risk comprises of currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\n(i) Foreign currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \nchanges in exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s operations and the Company’s net investments in foreign branches.\nThe exchange rate risk primarily arises from assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of the respective branches and foreign currency forecasted revenue and cash flows. A significant po/r_t.ligaion of the Company revenue is in US Dollar, Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro while a large po/r_t.ligaion of costs are in Indian rupees. The fluctuation in exchange rates in respect to India rupee may have potential impact on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and equity.\nTo mitigate the foreign currency risk, the Company uses derivatives as governed by the Company’s strategy, which \nprovides principles on the use of such forward contracts and currency options consistent with the Company’s Risk Management Policy.\nAppreciation/depreciation of 5% in respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the \nCompany & its branches would result in increase/decrease in the Company’s profit before tax by approximately /uni20B9537 crores (31 March 2024, /uni20B9575 crores) for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous \nparallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 5% against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its branches. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change.\nNon-derivative foreign currency exposure in major currencies is as below:\nFinancial assets Financial liabilities\n31 March 2025 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 31 March 2024\nUSD/INR 11,407 7,215 2,227 891\nGBP/INR 516 664 65 61\nEUR/INR 926 1,268 251 146\n(ii) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because \nof changes in market interest rates. The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence the Company is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash \nand bank balances, inter-corporate deposits, trade receivables, finance lease receivables, investment securities and derivative instruments. The cash resources of the Company are invested with mutual funds, banks, financial institutions and corporations after an evaluation of the credit risk. By their nature, all such financial instruments involve risks, including the credit risk of non-pe/r_f.ligaormance by counterpa/r_t.ligaies.\nThe customers of the Company are primarily corporations based in the United States of America and Europe and \naccordingly, trade receivables, unbilled receivables and finance lease receivables are concentrated in the respective countries.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are fu/r_t.ligaher described in the \nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit \nof the Consolidated Financial Statements  section of our \nrepo/r_t.liga. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Cha/r_t.ligaered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nKey Audit Ma/t_t.ligaer\nKey audit ma/t_t.ligaers are those ma/t_t.ligaers that, in our \nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These ma/t_t.ligaers were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these ma/t_t.ligaers.\nEvaluation of tax positions and litigations\nSee Note 1(i) and 3.25 to consolidated financial statementsThe key audit ma/t_t.ligaer How the ma/t_t.ligaer was addressed in our audit\nThe Group operates in multiple \nglobal jurisdictions which requires it to estimate its income tax liabilities according to the tax laws of the respective tax jurisdictions. Fu/r_t.ligaher, there are ma/t_t.ligaers of interpretation in terms of application of tax laws and related rules to determine current tax provision and deferred taxes.\nThe Group has material tax positions \nand litigations on a range of tax ma/t_t.ligaers primarily in India. This requires management to make significant judgments to determine the possible outcome of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations and their consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.In view of the significance of the ma/t_t.ligaer we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:\n● testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Group’s key controls over identifying unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and ma/t_t.ligaers involving litigations.\n● obtaining details of tax positions and tax litigations for the year and as at 31 March 2025 and holding discussions with designated management personnel.\n● assessing and analysing select key correspondences with tax authorities and inspecting external legal opinions obtained by management for key unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and tax litigations.\n● evaluating underlying evidence and documentation to determine whether the information provides a basis for amounts provided/not provided in the books of account.\n● involving our internal tax specialists and evaluating management’s underlying key assumptions in estimating the tax provisions and possible outcome of material tax positions and litigations; and\n● in respect of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations, assessing the computation of provisions and consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Information\nThe Holding Company’s Management and Board of \nDirectors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Repo/r_t.liga, including Annexures to Board’s Repo/r_t.liga, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Repo/r_t.liga"

If, based on the work we have pe/r_f.ligaormed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to repo/r_t.liga that fact. We have nothing to repo/r_t.liga in this regard.\nManagement’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for \nthe Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Holding Company’s Management and Board of \nDirectors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each entity and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, \nthe respective Management and Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of each entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, ma/t_t.ligaers related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe respective Board of Directors of the entities included \nin the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial repo/r_t.ligaing process of each entity.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s repo/r_t.liga that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs pa/r_t.liga of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and pe/r_f.ligaorm audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n● Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material unce/r_t.ligaainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material unce/r_t.ligaainty exists, we are required to draw a/t_t.ligaention in our auditor’s repo/r_t.liga to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s repo/r_t.liga. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n● Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the"

The Company was incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India in November 1991, having its registered office at 806, Siddha/r_t.ligah, 96, Nehru Place, New Delhi - 110019. The Group leverages its global technology workforce and intellectual prope/r_t.ligaies to deliver solutions across following ve/r_t.ligaicals - Financial Services, Manufacturing, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Public Services, Retail & CPG, Technology & Services and Telecom, Media, Publishing and Ente/r_t.ligaainment.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved and authorized for issue by the \nBoard of Directors on 22 April 2025.\n1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n(a) Basis of preparation\nThese consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting \nStandards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Schedule III (Division II) to the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable to the consolidated financial statements.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual \nand going concern basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:\n(a) Derivative financial instruments,\n(b) Ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments),\n(c) Defined benefit plans\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent \nwith those of the previous year except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy.\nAll assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal operating \ncycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method.\nThe Group uses the Indian rupee (‘/uni20B9’) as its repo/r_t.ligaing currency. All amounts are presented in crores of /uni20B9rounded to \nwhole number and amounts less than /uni20B90.50 crores are presented as “-”.\n(b) Basis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of HCL Technologies Limited, the Parent Company, and its subsidiaries. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.\nThe Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:(a) Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of \nthe investee),\n(b) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n(c) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To suppo/r_t.liga this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n(a) The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee\n(b) Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n(c) The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are \nchanges to one or more of the three elements of control."

    "text": "336 Consolidated Financial StatementsNotes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025\n(All amounts in crores of /uni20B9, except share data and as stated otherwise)\nThe financial statements of the subsidiaries in the Group are added on a line-by-line basis and inter-company \nbalances and transactions including unrealized gain/loss from such transactions, are eliminated upon consolidation. When the Group ceases control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is ceased. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use by the Group.\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control over \nfinancial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognized at cost. The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit and loss of an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n(c) Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates and judgements that affect the repo/r_t.ligaed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and other comprehensive income (OCI) that are repo/r_t.ligaed and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Group may unde/r_t.ligaake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the year in which the changes are made.\nSignificant estimates, judgements and assumptions are used for, but not limited to.(i.) Accounting for costs expected to be incurred to complete pe/r_f.ligaormance under fixed price projects and \ndetermination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation in contracts involving \nmultiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, refer note 1(g).\n(ii.) Allowance for uncollectible trade receivables, refer note 1(t)(i).\n(iii.) Fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent consideration) and fair value of the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed, measured on a provisional basis in case of business combination, refer note \n1(d).\n(iv.)

The cost of an acquisition is the \naggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value at the acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition \ndate. Contingent consideration classified as financial liability is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and \nthe amount recognized for non-controlling interest, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is recognized as capital reserve after reassessing the fair values of the net assets."

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency, and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation the gain or loss that is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method.\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional \ncurrency spot rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on se/t_t.ligalement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of initial transaction. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined.\nTransaction gains or losses realized upon se/t_t.ligalement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining \nnet profit for the year. Revenue, expenses and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.\nThe translation of foreign operations from respective functional currency into INR (the repo/r_t.ligaing currency) for \nassets and liabilities is pe/r_f.ligaormed using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and for revenue, expenses and cash flows is pe/r_f.ligaormed using an appropriate daily weighted average exchange rate for the respective years. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are repo/r_t.ligaed as a component of ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that pa/r_t.ligaicular foreign operation is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n(f) Fair value measurement\nThe Group records ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The Group determines fair values based on the price it would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market pa/r_t.ligaicipants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.\nThe Group holds ce/r_t.ligaain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which must be measured using \nthe guidance for fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies. The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Group’s assumptions about current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments \nin markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable in active markets.\nLevel 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable \ninputs which are suppo/r_t.ligaed by li/t_t.ligale or no market activity.\nIn accordance with Ind AS 113, assets and liabilities at fair value are measured based on the following valuation \ntechniques:\n(a) Market approach – Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving \nidentical or comparable assets or liabilities.\n(b) Income approach – Conve/r_t.ligaing the future amounts based on market expectations to its present value using the discounting method.\n(c) Cost approach – Replacement cost method."

These assets consist primarily of non-\nfinancial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in business combinations are measured at fair value initially and subsequently when there is an indicator of impairment, the impairment is recognized.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market pa/r_t.ligaicipant’s ability to generate \neconomic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r_t.ligaicipant who would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n(g) Revenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised service or good transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration (Transaction price) to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services (Pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation). Revenue is recognized for any contract, once it is approved in writing, is legally enforceable, the rights of the pa/r_t.ligaies are identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is measured based on the Transaction price which is the consideration of the contract and is shown net of applicable taxes and adjusted for any variable consideration like volume discounts, service level allowances, incentive or any other discount. Transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.\nRevenue from time-and-material, volume based, and transaction-based contracts is recognized as the related \nservices are pe/r_f.ligaormed through effo/r_t.ligas expended, units serviced, number of transactions processed, etc. that correspond with value transferred to customer.\nRevenue related to fixed price contracts where pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations and control are satisfied over a period \nof time like technology integration contracts, complex network building contracts, system implementations and application development contracts is recognized based on progress towards completion of the pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation using percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Any revision in cost to complete would result in an increase or decrease in revenue and such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified.\nIn arrangements involving sharing of customer revenues for services delivered, revenue is recognized when the \nright to receive such revenue share is established.\nRevenue related to other fixed price contracts providing maintenance and suppo/r_t.liga services, are recognized based \non the right to invoice for services pe/r_f.ligaormed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenues are recognized basis stand-alone selling price for the service pe/r_f.ligaormed. The Group uses cost plus expected margin to determine stand-alone selling price.\nRevenue from distinct proprietary software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement \nwhen right to use is granted to the customer. In the case of renewals of term licenses with existing customers, revenue from term license is recognized at a point in time when the renewal is agreed on signing of contracts. Revenue from suppo/r_t.liga and subscription (S&S) is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis as the Group is providing a service of standing ready to provide suppo/r_t.liga, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. In case software are bundled with suppo/r_t.liga and subscription either for perpetual or term based license, such suppo/r_t.liga and subscription contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the suppo/r_t.liga services are provided.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains provision of multiple products, services and software licenses, the Group \nidentifies the distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation including lease obligation and allocates total consideration to each pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation on a relative standalone selling price. Group uses cost plus expected margin to determine standalone selling price. Revenue from finance leases is recognized when all risks and ownership are transferred to the customer, with no remaining obligations that affect acceptance. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of lease payments, discounted at a market interest rate. Interest from finance leases is recognized as other income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.\nIn instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-pa/r_t.ligay vendor services, material or licenses, revenue is \nrecorded on a gross basis when the Group is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when the Group is"

Direct and incremental costs in relation to such transition activities which are expected to be recoverable under the contract are considered as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Deferred contract cost and recognized over the period of arrangement. Ce/r_t.ligaain upfront non-recurring incremental contract acquisition costs and other upfront fee paid to customer are deferred and classified as Deferred contract cost and amo/r_t.ligaized to revenue, usually on a straight-line basis, over the term of the contract.\nAn onerous contract provision is recognized when the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the future \nobligations exceed the expected economic benefits to be received under a contract. Such provision, if any, is recorded in the period in which such losses become probable and is included in the cost of revenues.\nContract assets are recognized when revenue recognized is more than billing and right to consideration is \nconditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Unbilled receivables are recognized where the right to consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before the payment is due (i.e., only act of invoicing is pending). Contract liability is Group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to customers when there is excess billing over the revenue recognized.\n(h) Other income\nOther income mainly comprises interest income on debt securities, bank and other deposits, other interest income recognized using the effective interest method, profit on sale of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipments, debt securities and mutual fund and net foreign exchange gains.\n(i) Income taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax.\nIncome tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items \nrecognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes the impact of provisions established for unce/r_t.ligaain income tax positions. Tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the asset and se/t_t.ligale the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases \nof assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for those temporary differences which originate during the tax holiday period and are reversed after the tax holiday period. For this purpose, reversal of timing differences is determined using first-in-first-out method.\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or se/t_t.ligaled.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current \ntax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\nThe effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or \nexpense in the year that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future."

The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nIn some tax jurisdictions, the amount of tax deductions on share based payments to employees are different \nfrom the related cumulative remuneration expenses. If the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, such excess amount of tax deduction and the associated tax benefit is recognized directly in retained earnings.\n(j) Prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment\nPrope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and directly a/t_t.ligaributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. The Group identifies and determines separate useful lives for each major component of the prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, if they have a useful life that is materially different from that of the asset as a whole.\nExpenses on existing prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repairs, maintenance expenditure and \ncost of replacing pa/r_t.ligas, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the year during which such expenses are incurred.\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal \nproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.\nPrope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment under construction and cost of assets not ready for use at the year-end are \ndisclosed as capital work - in- progress.\nDepreciation on prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method over their estimated \nuseful lives, as determined by the management. Depreciation is charged on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/sold during the year.\nThe management’s estimates of the useful lives of various assets for computing depreciation are as follows:\nAsset description Asset life (in years)\nBuildings 20\nPlant and equipment (including air conditioners, electrical installations) 10\nOffice equipment 5\nComputers and networking equipment 4-5\nFurniture and fixtures 7\nVehicles 5\nThe useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the management expects to use these \nassets, based on technical assessment. The estimated useful lives for these assets are therefore different from the useful lives prescribed under Pa/r_t.liga C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are reviewed at \neach financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n(k) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequently, following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are amo/r_t.ligaized over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication \nthat the intangible asset may be impaired. The amo/r_t.ligaization period and the amo/r_t.ligaization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each repo/r_t.ligaing year. Changes in the"

The amo/r_t.ligaization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net \ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.\nThe intangible assets are amo/r_t.ligaized over the estimated useful life of the assets as mentioned below :\nAsset description Asset life (in years)\nSoftware Over the term of license or \n3 years, whichever is lower\nTechnology (including Licensed IPRs) 2 to 15\nCustomer - related intangibles (includes customer contracts and customer \nrelationships)1 to 10\nOthers (includes intellectual prope/r_t.ligay rights, brand and non-compete agreements)2 to 6\n(l) Research and development costs\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure, on an individual project, is recognized as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:\n● The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale\n● Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset\n● How the asset will generate future economic benefits\n● The availability of resources to complete the asset\n● The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development\nSubsequently, following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and accumulated impairment losses. Amo/r_t.ligaization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amo/r_t.ligaized over the period of expected future benefit. Amo/r_t.ligaization expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.\n(m) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalized as pa/r_t.liga of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.\nBorrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of \nfunds.\n(n) Leases\nA lease is a contract that contains right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nGroup as a lessee\nGroup is lessee in case of leasehold land, office space, accommodation for its employees & IT equipment. These leases are evaluated to determine whether it contains lease based on principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors as defined in Ind AS 116.\nRight-of-use asset represents the Group’s right to control the underlying assets under lease and the lease \nliability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying asset under lease. Right-of-use asset is measured initially based on the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent, and lease"

Right-of - use asset is depreciated based on straight line method over the lease term or useful life of \nright-of-use asset, whichever is less. Subsequently, right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability.\nThe lease liability is measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the \nminimum lease payments not yet paid and the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the Group would borrow, in the country where the lease was executed. The Group has used a single discount rate for a po/r_t.ligafolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The lease payment comprises fixed payment less any lease incentives, variable lease payment that depends on an index or a rate, exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably ce/r_t.ligaain to exercise the option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease. Lease liability is subsequently measured by increase the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payment made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or modification, if any.\nThe Group has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of 12 months or less in the consolidated balance \nsheet, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those sho/r_t.liga-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. For all asset classes, the Group has elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and account for the combined unit as a single lease component in case there is no separate payment defined under the contract.\nGroup as a lessor\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the year in which they are earned or contingency is resolved.\nLeases in which the Group transfers substantially all the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified \nas finance leases. Assets given under finance lease are recognized as a receivables at an amount equal to the present value of lease receivables. After initial recognition, the Group appo/r_t.ligaions lease rentals between the principal repayment and interest income so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance leases. The interest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs such as legal cost, brokerage cost etc. are recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\nWhen arrangements include multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, the Group allocates the consideration in the \ncontract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.\n(o) Inventories\nStock-in-trade, stores and spares are valued at the lower of the cost or net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\nCost of stock-in-trade procured for specific projects is assigned by identifying individual costs of each item. Cost \nof stock-in-trade, that are interchangeable and not specific to any project and cost of stores and spare pa/r_t.ligas are determined using the weighted average cost formula.\n(p) Impairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually on March 31, for impairment, or sooner whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and future cash flows. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including"

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the \nhigher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.\nAn impairment loss on goodwill recognized in the statement of profit and loss is not reversed in the subsequent \nperiod.\nIntangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment\nIntangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. Subsequently if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is reversed. Such reversal is made only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined on the date of reversal, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Such impairment and any subsequent reversal is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n(q) Provisions and contingent liabilities\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.\nThe Group uses significant judgement to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed \nwhen there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more unce/r_t.ligaain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n(r) Retirement and other employee benefits\n(i) Provident fund: Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries in India receive benefits under the provident \nfund, a defined benefit plan. The employee and employer each make monthly contributions to the plan. A po/r_t.ligaion of the contribution is made to the provident fund trust managed by the Group or Government administered provident fund; while the balance contribution is made to the Government administered pension fund, a defined contribution plan. For the contribution made by the Company and its subsidiaries in India to the provident fund trust managed by the Group, the Company has an obligation to fund any sho/r_t.ligafall on the yield of the Trust’s investments over the administered interest rates. The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of the year. The funds contributed to the Trust are invested in specific securities as mandated by law and generally consist of federal and state government bonds, debt instruments of government-owned corporations, equity and other eligible market securities.\n(ii) In respect of superannuation, a defined contribution plan for applicable employees, the Company \ncontributes to the superannuation trust and the scheme is administered on its behalf by appointed fund managers and such contributions for each year of service rendered by the employees are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The Company has no fu/r_t.ligaher obligations to the superannuation plan beyond its contributions.\n(iii) Gratuity liability: The Company and its subsidiaries in India and ce/r_t.ligaain foreign geographies provide for \ngratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment,"

The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial gains/losses are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.\nIn respect to ce/r_t.ligaain employees in India, the Company contributes towards gratuity liabilities to the Gratuity \nFund Trust. Trustees of the Company administer contributions made to the Trust and contributions are invested in a scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India as permi/t_t.ligaed by law.\n(iv) Compensated absences: The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated absences which are \nboth accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The employees can carry forward up to the specified po/r_t.ligaion of the unutilized accumulated compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation (using the projected unit credit method) based on the additional amount expected to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. The expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which the absences occur.

The Company measures share-based compensation cost at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight line basis (net of estimated fo/r_f.ligaeitures) over the employee’s requisite service period for an award with only service condition and for an award with both service and pe/r_f.ligaormance condition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting po/r_t.ligaion of the award, as if award was in substance, multiple awards. On modification of an equity se/t_t.ligaled award, the Company re-estimates the fair value of stock option as on the date of modification and any incremental expense is expensed over the period from the modification date till the vesting date.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options using option pricing model. The cost is recorded under the \nhead employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss with corresponding increase in “Share based payment reserve”.\n(t) Financial Instruments\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\ni. Financial assets\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the \nacquisition of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit and loss) are added to the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset. Purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash in banks and sho/r_t.liga-term deposits and investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value."

In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities.\nFinancial assets at amo/r_t.ligaized cost\nA financial asset is measured at the amo/r_t.ligaized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n(a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n(b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category includes cash and bank balances, loans, unbilled receivables, trade and other receivables.\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)\nA financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n(i) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling \nthe financial assets, and\n(ii) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\nFinancial asset included within the OCI category are measured initially as well as at each repo/r_t.ligaing date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in OCI. Interest income is recognized in statement of profit and loss for debt instruments. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from OCI to statement of profit and loss.\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss\nAny financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization at amo/r_t.ligaized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, is classified at fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets included at the fair value through profit and loss category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nEquity investments\nAll equity instruments are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently re-measured with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. In limited circumstances, investments, for which sufficient, more recent information to measure fair value is not available cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nA financial asset is primarily derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance is recognized for trade receivables with no significant financing component. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case they are measured at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r_t.ligaing date is recognized in statement of profit and loss."

Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and \npayables, net of directly a/t_t.ligaributable transaction costs.\nThe subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated as \nsuch at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\nFinancial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost\nThe Group’s financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost, are initially recognized at net of transaction costs and includes trade payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts and other payables.\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective \ninterest rate (EIR) method except for deferred consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amo/r_t.ligaization process.\nAmo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or \ncosts that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.\niii. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nForeign exchange forward contracts and options are purchased to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with forecast transactions denominated in ce/r_t.ligaain foreign currencies.\nThe Group recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. Changes in fair value \nfor derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are marked to market at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and the related gains (losses) are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as ‘foreign exchange gains (losses)’.\nThe foreign exchange forward contracts and options in respect of forecasted transactions which meet the \nhedging criteria are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives (net of tax) that are designated as effective cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in the hedging reserve account as a component of accumulated ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’ until the hedged transaction occurs and are then recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The ineffective po/r_t.ligaion of hedging derivatives is immediately recognized in other income (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss.\nIn respect of derivatives designated as hedges, the Group formally documents all relationships between \nhedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for unde/r_t.ligaaking various hedge transactions. The Group also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively from the last testing date when (1) it is determined that the \nderivative financial instrument is no longer effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure being hedged; (2) the derivative financial instrument matures or is sold, terminated or exercised; or (3) it is determined that designating the derivative financial instrument as a hedge is no"

When hedge accounting is discontinued the deferred gains or losses on the cash flow \nhedge remain in ‘other comprehensive income (loss)’ until the forecast transaction occurs. Any fu/r_t.ligaher change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current year earnings.\nOffse/t_t.ligaing of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is repo/r_t.ligaed in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to se/t_t.ligale on a net basis to realize the assets and se/t_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously.\n(u) Dividend\nFinal dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is recognized upon approval by the shareholders who have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend excludes dividend on treasury shares.\n(v) Earnings per share (EPS)\nBasic EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for treasury shares held.\nDiluted EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Parent \nCompany by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The diluted potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares). Pe/r_f.ligaormance based stock unit awards are included in dilutive potential shares when they become contingently issuable and have a dilutive impact and are excluded when they are not contingently issuable. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed conve/r_t.ligaed as at the beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each year presented.\nThe number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented \nfor bonus shares.\n(w) Nature and purpose of reserves\nRemeasurement of defined benefit plans\nThe Group recognizes actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans in the balance sheet with a corresponding \ndebit or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\nTreasury share reserve\nThe Company’s equity shares held by a trust, which is consolidated as a pa/r_t.liga of the Group, are classified as \nTreasury shares. Treasury shares are carried at acquisition cost and presented as a deduction from total equity as “Treasury share reserve”. As and when treasury shares are transferred to employees on exercise after satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the balance lying in “Treasury share reserve” is transferred to “Retained earnings”.\nSecurities premium\nSecurities premium is used to record the premium on issue of shares. The reserve can be utilized only for limited \npurposes such as issuance of bonus shares and buyback of shares in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 in India.\nCapital redemption reserve\nThe Group recognizes cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments to capital redemption reserve.\nShare based payment reserve\nThe share-based payment reserve is recognized over the vesting period at the grant date fair value of units issued \nto employees of the Group under the Company’s restricted stock unit plan."

The eligible units are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the expo/r_t.liga of services for the first five years from the year of commencement of operations and 50% of such profits and gains for the next five years. Ce/r_t.ligaain tax benefits are also available for a fu/r_t.ligaher period of five years subject to meeting reinvestment conditions. The aforesaid tax benefits will not be available to units having commenced the operations after 31 March 2021.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries in India are subject to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) on its book profits if normal tax \nliability is lower than MAT, which gives rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability. MAT paid for a year can be set-off against the normal tax liability within fifteen subsequent years, expiring between the years 2025 to 2039.\nIn India, Corporate taxpayers can opt for a specified lower tax rate in lieu of current applicable tax rate subject to \ntaxpayers not claiming any specified tax incentives including tax incentives available to special economic zone units and carryover of unutilized MAT credit (‘new tax regime’). The Company will opt for new tax regime in the year new tax regime is beneficial to the Company.\nThe tax returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where the Group conducts \nbusiness. The Group’s two major tax jurisdictions are India and USA. Tax examination is open in USA for tax years beginning 1 April 2017 onwards and for India, regular tax examination is open for tax years beginning 1 April 2022 and ce/r_t.ligaain ma/t_t.ligaers relating to prior years for which the tax assessment has already got concluded are subject to ongoing litigations, appeals and reassessment proceedings. The Company has significant inter-company transactions with its subsidiaries including in USA and UK. The Company has also filed for bilateral advance pricing agreements in ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions sta/r_t.ligaing from 1 April 2017 for some of which the resolutions have been reached during the year and accounted for in the consolidated financial statements. For ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions, the resolution is yet to be reached. Resolution of these ma/t_t.ligaers involves some degree of unce/r_t.ligaainty; accordingly, the Group recognizes income tax liability that it believes will ultimately result from the proceedings."

The use of derivatives to hedge the risk is governed by the Group’s strategy, which provides principles on the use of such forward contracts and currency options consistent with the Group’s risk management policy. The Group determines hedge ratio based on prevailing market conditions, availability and liquidity of hedging instruments, and hedge ineffectiveness. The counterpa/r_t.ligaies in these derivative instruments are banks and the Group considers the risks of non-pe/r_f.ligaormance by the counterpa/r_t.ligaies as insignificant. The Group has entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts and options that are designated as cash flow hedges and the related forecasted transactions extend through March 2030.

Inherent risk exists for the Company that any adverse salary growth or demographic experience or inadequate returns on underlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.\nDiscount rate and future salary escalation rate are the key actuarial assumptions to which the defined benefit \nobligation are pa/r_t.ligaicularly sensitive. The following table summarizes the impact on defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2025 arising due to increase/decrease in key actuarial assumptions by 50 basis points:\nDiscount rate Salary escalation rate\nAs at As at\n31 March 2025 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 31 March 2024\nImpact of increase (30) (24) 31 25\nImpact of decrease 32 25 (30) (24)\nThe sensitivity analysis presented may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligations in isolation and assuming there are no other changes in market conditions. There have been no changes from the previous years in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.\nThe defined benefit obligations are expected to mature after 31 March 2025 as follows:\nYear ending 31 March Cash flows\n- 2026 188\n- 2027 241\n- 2028 263\n- 2029 283\n- 2030 286\n- Thereafter 3,508\nThe weighted average duration for the payment of these cash flows is 5.57 years."

Some of these ma/t_t.ligaers include speculative and frivolous claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Group records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Group reviews these provisions at least qua/r_t.ligaerly and adjusts these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, se/t_t.ligalements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. The Group believes that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of the Group, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as at 31 March 2025.\n(c) A wholly owned subsidiary (‘WOS’) of the Company, having a VSAT License, had received a demand from Depa/r_t.ligament of Telecommunications (DoT) in February 2015 for FY 2011-12 and FY 2013-14 for an amount of /uni20B9133 crores, including penalty, interest and interest on penalty. In July 2021, the WOS has received a revised demand for an amount of /uni20B9346 crores after updating interest up to July 2021. Demand is primarily due to DoT including IT Services revenues and related exchange gains in Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). In March 2022, the WOS received a favourable judgement from TDSAT se/t_t.ligaing aside the demand raised by DoT. In August 2023, DoT has filed an appeal against the order passed by TDSAT in the Hon’ble Supreme Cou/r_t.liga. Appeal, including condonation of delay in filing the appeal, is yet to be admi/t_t.ligaed by Hon’ble Supreme Cou/r_t.liga. Subsequent to this appeal, the WOS has obtained a legal opinion and is of the view that it should be able to defend its position in the above ma/t_t.ligaer.\n3.35 Additional information under general instructions for the preparation of consolidated financial statements of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013\nS.
